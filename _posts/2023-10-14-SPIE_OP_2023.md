Recently we published a series of conference proceedings from the SPIE Optics+Photonics meeting which explore potential approaches to lowering the cost of large space telescopes and coronagraphs:
1. The first, in **Douglas, et al. (2023, September 1). Approaches to lowering the cost of large space telescopes. [arXiv.2309.04934](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2309.04934)** we discussed how to translate lessons from ground-based observatories and NewSpace/CubeSat science into lower cost observatories and introduced a power-spectral-density parameterizations of wavefront evolution over time inspired by ground-based adaptive optics techniques.

1. **Kim, D. et al. (2023, September 1).Compact Three Mirror Anastigmat Space Telescope Design using 6.5m Monolithic Primary Mirror. [arXiv.2309.04921](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2309.04921)**, introduced a telescope concept that uses a classic UArizona 6.5m borosilicate mirror and fits within a SpaceX Starship fairing without deployables,
1. **Choi, H. et al. (2023).  Approaches to developing tolerance and error budget for active three mirror anastigmat space telescopes. [arXiv.2310.12376](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12376)**  Summarized a notional tolerance budget to show that such a concept is capable of diffraction limited imaging. 
1. building on those two papers, Kang et al  described a lab experiment to begin validating the phase retrieval approaches introduced in Douglas et al: **Kang, H., et al. (2023, September 1). Focus diverse phase retrieval testbed development of continuous wavefront sensing for space telescope applications. arXiv E-Prints. [arXiv.2309.04680](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2309.04680)**, 
1. applying lessons from bending mode control of ground-based observatories to the parameter  **Blomquist, et al. (2023, September 1). Analysis of active optics correction for a large honeycomb mirror. arXiv E-Prints. [arXiv.2309.04584](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2309.04584).**
2.   **Derby, K. Z., et al. (2023, September 1). Integrated modeling of wavefront sensing and control for space telescopes utilizing active and adaptive optics. arXiv E-Prints. [arXiv.2309.05748](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2309.05748)**


In 2020 we introduced a simple of-axis coronagraph design: **Maier, et al. (2020) [arXiv.2109.12718](http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.12718)**

Which was followed up in 2022 be the design and first-light papers for a vacuum coronagraph test bed based on on the same optical design: Ashcraft, et al (2022). [arXiv.2208.01156](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2208.01156) and Van Gorkom, K., et al. (2022). [arXiv.2208.01155](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2208.01155).

At this year's meeting we did a deep dive on a few areas of particular interest to the same coronagraph design, radiation-tolerant deformable mirror controllers: 
1. **Haughwout, C., et al.  (2023). Compact deformable mirror driver electronics for risk tolerant astrophysics missions. In Astronomical Optics: Design, Manufacture, and Test of Space and Ground Systems IV (Vol. 12677, pp. 63â€“76). SPIE. [10.1117/12.2677714](https://doi.org/10.1117/12.2677714)_**

1. We also assessed the limitations on coronagraph contrast due to polarization aberrations

1. and the quality of artificial stars (pinholes) used for coronagraph testing:**Jenkins, E. L., et al. (2023, September 1). Microfabricated pinholes for high contrast imaging testbeds. arXiv E-Prints. [arXiv.2309.04604](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2309.04604)**
